# Star Wars RPG

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... there was no JavaScript.  Luckily for us, we don't live a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

This is a basic Star Wars themed role-playing game where you can choose your character from four and then fight the other three.  There are different combinations that you can choose to fight your foes.  Some will lead you to victory, but others will lead you to defeat.  It is up to you to figure out which path is the correct path, depending on which hero you choose.

This is a dynamic webpage that responds entirely to clicks.  Images and buttons appear as you need them, but are missing from the page when they are irrelevant.  You click on the hero that you would like to choose, then click on which opponent you would like to face.  Once your foe has been established, you click on the attack button to battle.  If and when you defeat your first foe, you must face another, and defeating them, the final foe.  If you survive, congratulations!  Click on the restart button to play again.  If you don't, no worries.  You can still try again!

This was an exercise in using heavy amounts of jQuery, which I used primarily for getting ids, objects, etc, to use in other jQuery-based functions.
